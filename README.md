How to Use
A verification process can be used to verify a user's phone number. The Verify API confirms that a user is in possession of a specific device based on a phone number. To start a verification process, you'll need the number to be verified, and your name so the recipient can identify .

Be sure the number is in international format. Make a call to (https://v2.namsor.com/NamSorAPIv2/api2/json/phoneCode), /FirstName/LastName/Number with those parameters, along with your api_key and headers .

httpOptions = {
headers: new HttpHeaders 
'Accept': 'application/json',
'x-api-key': '4ac7667457defcf5e4ebdaa6cb985e5d'
}
Your format will be look like (https://v2.namsor.com/NamSorAPIv2/api2/json/phoneCode/John/Doe/+12123232117)
This is your API key: "4ac7667457defcf5e4ebdaa6cb985e5d"
